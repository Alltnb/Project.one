    <h1>dogs info</h1>
    <p> The dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment.[138][139] In 2013, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million[140] and 987 million.[141] About 20% of dogs live as pets in developed countries.[142] In the developing world, it is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs.[143] Most of these dogs live as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing that village dogs' most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%).[144]
